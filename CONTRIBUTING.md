# Contributing to Shearlight

This repository contains the Shearlight theme for ScissorHands.NET, not the
engine. It renders static HTML with Razor and uses framework-free CSS and plain
JavaScript.
See the [theme documentation](https://getscissorhands.app/docs/themes/) for
theme APIs and customization.

## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Getting Started

To contribute to Shearlight, fork and clone this repository.

Install the .NET SDK selected by [global.json](global.json), then create a
branch using `type/short-kebab-case-description`, such as
`feat/theme-navigation`, `fix/tag-links`, or `docs/preview-setup`.

Before building, follow the [local preview setup](README.md#local-preview) to
ensure the sample's theme link points to this checkout's `src` directory.
From the repository root, run:

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build --configuration Release --no-restore
```

## Making Changes

Follow [.editorconfig](.editorconfig), nearby code conventions, and the theme
contracts in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). Keep changes focused and include directly
related documentation.

Keep package versions in [Directory.Packages.props](Directory.Packages.props)
and project references versionless. Preserve the existing major-version
floating policy. Dependabot checks NuGet and GitHub Actions weekly; floating
NuGet references may not result in version-update pull requests.

Do not introduce a browser runtime, UI framework, or JavaScript build step
without discussing the change first. Do not commit credentials, local settings
containing secrets, or generated `bin`, `obj`, `preview`, `dist`, or package
outputs.

## Checking Changes

There are currently no automated test projects; CI restores packages and builds
the Release solution. Its test step remains disabled until test projects are
added. Do not treat a successful `dotnet test` invocation with no test projects
as test coverage.

For rendering, navigation, or asset changes, run the sample from its directory:

```bash
cd sample
dotnet run -- --preview
```

Inspect the rendered output and exercise affected views, desktop/mobile widths,
light/dark modes, keyboard controls, and navigation without JavaScript. Check a
subpath base URL when changing links or assets. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for
the relevant theme contracts and [sample/README.md](sample/README.md) for preview
details.

Stop the preview before rebuilding. To generate static output instead, run
`dotnet run -- --build` from `sample`. Documentation-only changes do not require
a .NET build.

## Releases

The [build, release, and deploy workflow](.github/workflows/main.yaml) creates
a GitHub release and deploys the production sample to GitHub Pages whenever a
new `v*` tag is pushed, after the Release solution build succeeds. Use `v`
followed by a [SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) version, such as `v1.2.3` or
`v1.2.3-preview.1`. The workflow extracts the version from the tag without
enforcing full SemVer syntax or setting GitHub's prerelease flag. Version
suffixes and build metadata such as `v1.2.3+build.42` are preserved.

Releases attach `shearlight-<tag>.zip` with the theme sources and assets (excluding
`bin` and `obj`) alongside GitHub's standard source archives and automatically
generated release notes. The workflow sets `src/theme.json` to the tag version
in the build workspace; it does not publish NuGet packages or require the
committed manifest version to match the tag.

The production sample is generated with `Site:BaseUrl` set to `/shearlight/`
and `Site:SiteUrl` set to `https://getscissorhands.app`, then deployed at
`https://getscissorhands.app/shearlight/`. Local preview settings remain
unchanged. Never deploy the preview output.

Branch pushes, updates to existing tags, pull requests, and manual workflow runs
only build the solution and do not create releases or deploy Pages.

## Pull Request Process

- Keep each commit a complete logical change that can be reviewed and reverted
  independently.
- Complete every section of the [pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md),
  using `N/A` where appropriate.
- Explain the motivation, approach, breaking changes, and any migration steps.
- Describe how you checked the result and disclose checks that were blocked or
  not performed. Ensure CI passes before requesting a merge.
- Link related issues; use a closing reference only when the pull request
  actually resolves the issue.

## Commit Convention

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) in the form
`type(scope): description`, with an optional scope. For example:
`fix(theme): preserve subpath tag links` or `docs: clarify preview setup`.

Allowed types are `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`,
`refactor`, `revert`, `style`, and `test`. Use the same types as branch prefixes.
Mark breaking changes with `!` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.

## Reporting Bugs

Use the [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/01-BUG-REPORT.yml).
Include steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and your environment details.
Report suspected vulnerabilities privately using [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md),
not in a public issue. For usage questions, see [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md).

## Requesting Features

Use the [feature request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/02-FEATURE-REQUEST.yml).
Describe the problem, your proposed solution, and any alternatives considered.
